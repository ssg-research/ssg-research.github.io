# Secure Systems Group

We provide instructions on how to modify webapges in this repository or create a project webpage.

## How to modify webpages?

### Run the repository locally and test

With [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed: 

`docker-compose up`

### Directly modifying the repository on github (not recommended)

You can edit the files directly on github for any minor changes (e.g., typos, change in links)
but for any creation of new files with extensive changes, please fork and send a pull request.

## How to create a project webpage?

For creating the project webpage for the first time, please use the template: https://github.com/ssg-research/ssg-research.github.io/blob/master/_projects/template.html

The project webpages should be added to _projects/mlsec or _projects/platsec with the filename as <projectname>.html
Once the project page has been created, link to the project webpage in _pages/mlsec.md or _pages/platsec.md as [Model extraction attacks and defenses](/_projects/mlsec/modelExtDef)

Please make changes only to your own project pages and not the rest of the website.

## Contact

For any questions, please contact Michael or Vasisht
