At UWaterloo, SSG is part <a href="https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CrySP</a> at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Waterloo</a>. SSGâ€™s focus is on understanding how to design and build systems that are simultaneously secure, easy to use, and inexpensive to deploy. This involves both building and evaluating systems but also occasionally breaking the security and privacy guarantees claimed by existing systems.</p> <p>SSG came to Waterloo when <a href="https://asokan.org/asokan/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. N. Asokan</a> moved from <a href="https://cs.aalto.fi/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Aalto University</a> to <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science</a> in Fall 2019.
